### Memory Game (MemoryGame.jsx)
This component handles the logic of the memory game, including card generation, click handling, and match checking.

### Card (Card.jsx)
This component represents an individual card in the memory game. Manages the visual presentation of cards, displaying the corresponding icon when the card is flipped.
